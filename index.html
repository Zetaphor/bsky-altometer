    <h2>Why Alt Text Matters</h2>
    <p>
      Alt text (alternative text) is crucial for web accessibility and inclusivity. It provides a textual description
      of images for users who rely on screen readers, have slow internet connections, or when images fail to load.
      <br><br>
      By adding meaningful alt text to your images, you create a more inclusive and
      user-friendly experience for all visitors to your Bluesky posts.
      <br><br>
      Alt text also helps to increase the reach and audience of your image posts, the content of the alt text is used as
      part of the information that is used to recommend content to users.
      <br><br>
      Some labellers will even remove your posts from their feeds if they don't have alt text! Additionally some users
      will refuse to share your content if it's missing alt text!
